 * stays alive so request cancellation is observable: the runner's `done`
 * event can only fire once this process is killed by a {cancel} control
 * message (it never exits on its own while the keep-alive interval runs).
 *
 * A safety-net timer bounds the lifetime of any orphaned instance so a
 * failed test cannot leak processes indefinitely.
